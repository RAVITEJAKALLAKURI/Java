/**
 * Bounded Counting Semaphore implementation.
 * 
 * A counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits. Each acquire() blocks if necessary until a
 * permit is available, and then takes it. Each release() adds a permit, potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. However, 
 * no actual permit objects are used; the Semaphore just keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.
 * 
 * Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can access some (physical or logical) resource.
