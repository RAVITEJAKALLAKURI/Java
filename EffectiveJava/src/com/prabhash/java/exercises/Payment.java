/**
 * Immutable Class:  An immutable class is simply a class whose instances cannot be modified. These are Thread-Safe.
 * E.g., String, BigInteger, Integer and all other wrapper classes.
 * 
 * Here are the properties of an Immutable Class:
 *  - Don’t provide any mutator methods
 *  - Ensure that the class can’t be extended
 *  - Generally accomplished by making the class final
 *  - Make all fields private final
 *  - Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components
 *     – If the class has any fields that refer to mutable objects, ensure that clients of the class cannot obtain references to these objects
 *     – Never initialize such a field to a client-provided object or return the object reference from an accessor
