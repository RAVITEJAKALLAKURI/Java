/**
 * 
 * Quicksort, or partition-exchange sort, is a sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare that, on average, makes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. It's
 * a Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
 * 
 * In Quick Sort, we pick a random element called pivot and partition the array such that all numbers that are less than the partitioning element
 * comes before all elements that are greater than it. Repeated partition of the array and it's sub-arrays around an element eventually sorts the array.
 * 
 * Properties of Quick Sort:
 * 		- Since the partitioned element is not guaranteed to be the median or anywhere near the median, this can make Quick Sort sorting slow and in these cases
 * 		  time complexity could be O(n ^ 2)
 * 		- Before starting the quick sort, shuffle the algorithm for higher performance guarantee.
 * 		- This is a non-stable sort.
 * 		
 * Application:
 * 		- Java's Arrays.sort() uses Quick Sort algorithm.
 *  
 * Best Time Complexity = O(nlog(n))
 * Worst Time Complexity = O(n^2)
 * Space complexity = O(n) auxiliary naive
 * Space complexity = O(log n) auxiliary (Sedgewick 1978) [Used by the System Stack for Recursion]
